Alpha Symbols is a website designed to write your username with UTF-8 characters that resembles to alphabetic ones.

⚠️ Depending on the font used where you paste it, the characters might appear as squares. In this case, it means that UTF-8 is not supported.  
⚠️ I highly recommend to use this for cosmetics and not for an actual username (ex: "Server Nickname" option of Discord).
